Analyzing Loan Dynamics at a Bank Using Power BI
Excited to share key insights from a recent project that was part of a selection round for a position I'm passionate about. Leveraging Power BI, I dove into a comprehensive exploratory data analysis, utilizing data modeling, Power Query, and DAX functions to unearth critical findings in loan data. From identifying the impact of loan purposes on repayment rates to analyzing credit line durations, this project highlighted the importance of data-driven decision-making in finance. It was a fantastic challenge that not only honed my analytical skills but also demonstrated the potential of advanced data manipulation techniques in uncovering valuable business insights.
**1) Understanding the Dataset**
First, get a good understanding of the dataset's structure and the meaning of each column. Common features in loan datasets include:

Loan Amount: The total amount of loan disbursed.
Interest Rate: The interest rate applied to the loan.
Term: The loan term length (in years or months).
Monthly Payment: The monthly payment amount.
Grade/Subgrade: The loan grade assigned by the platform, often from A (best) to G (worst).
Employment Length: How long the borrower has been employed.
Annual Income: The borrower's annual income.
Loan Status: The current status of the loan (e.g., Fully Paid, Charged Off, Default, etc.).
Purpose: The purpose of the loan (e.g., debt consolidation, home improvement).
DTI (Debt-to-Income Ratio): A ratio calculated by dividing a borrower's total monthly debt payments by their gross monthly income.
Credit Score: The borrower's credit score
